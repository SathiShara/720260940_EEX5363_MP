# First Fit Memory Allocation-GUI Implementation

This mini project demonstrates the First Fit Memory Allocation Algorithm using Python. The algorithm is implemented with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the `tkinter` library.

## Features
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Simulates the First Fit algorithm for memory management.
- User-Friendly GUI: Provides an interface to input memory block sizes and process sizes.
- Detailed Results: Displays which process is allocated to which memory block or marked as "Not Allocated."

## How to Use
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/first-fit-memory-allocation.git
   cd first-fit-memory-allocation
